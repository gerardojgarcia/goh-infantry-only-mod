Dynamic Conquest/Campaign by editing the conquest preset under:

Changes:
- Only infantry and emplacement armies can be fielded. No vehicles or tanks. Airstriks can still be called in. 
- I may be able to fine tune it in the future to include light vehicles, or no artillery. or only level 1-2 artillery.
